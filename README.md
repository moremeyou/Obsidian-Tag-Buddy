# Obsidian Tag Buddy üîñ
Add, edit and remove tags in reading mode. Copy, move or edit tagged blocks in reading and edit mode. 

### ‚úèÔ∏è  Use 1: Add tags to note in reading-mode
![Add Tag Demo](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8971804/273914678-1f574966-a8fe-4fe4-8c91-7c3ef828c8c9.gif)

Add tag to text block/areas with **CTRL/CMD+RIGHT-CLICK**. Recently added tags are saved. Lock this list in settings, effectively making a favorites list. 

### ü´• Use 2: Remove tags in reading-mode
![Remove Tag Demo](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8971804/273923015-9eb2de41-3aeb-4243-9655-efdf4fd70ace.gif)

**CLICK** to remove tags in the active note, embedded note/block or generated tag summary blocks. **DOUBLE-TAP** on mobile. Hold **CTRL/CMD+CLICK** to use the native tag search. Customize this in plugin settings. 

### ü™∫  Use 3: Edit nested tags in reading mode
![Nested Tag Demo](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8971804/273923013-0b449539-cd7d-4c50-bb30-a2eb7c66dc93.gif)

If there are nested tags, Tag Buddy will progressively remove these first. 

### üßº  Use 4: Convert tags to text in reading-mode
![Convert Tag Demo](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8971804/273923003-d22b0c3e-39dc-4444-8716-fa9bcb327319.gif)

Removes the hash (converts the tag to text) with **OPT/ALT+CLICK** on desktop or **PRESS+HOLD** on mobile.

### üîé  Use 5: Add/edit tags in tag summaries
![Tag Summary Demo](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8971804/274069683-1e6257a6-f6d6-402a-adae-c534c2f5a507.gif)

Tags are editable in the active note, native embeds and when rendered using a tag summary code block. Use this syntax:
````markdown
```tag-summary
tags: #tag1 #tag2 // Find notes that have these tags (required)
include: #tag3 #tag4 // Results must also have these tags (optional)
exclude: #tag5 #tag6 // But not have these tags (optional)
max: 3 // Limits the results in the summary (optional)
```
````
Thanks to [Tag Summary Plugin](https://github.com/macrojd/tag-summary) for the original code behind the summaries.
### üî§  Use 6 (BETA): Copy/remove tagged blocks
- Copy button: copy's paragraph to clipboard.
- Remove-tag button: removes the queried tag from the paragraph (which also removes it from the summary).
	- Made a mistake? Use notices to easily jump to the tagged note.
![Notice Demo](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8971804/274208965-fb8423e7-4f64-4bf6-84e8-afe1d44d81b4.gif)

Enable these buttons in plugin settings. 

### üìë   Use 7 (BETA): Copy/move tagged blocks to section
![Copy To Section Demo](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8971804/274069666-d56b899c-1d74-411b-8b6e-c048bc8df491.gif)

Buttons added to each tagged paragraph in summaries let you copy the paragraph (with a back link) to header sections in the active note. Use **CTRL/CMD** when clicking to also remove the tag, effectively moving the paragraph to the section. These buttons will appear when you add section details to the tag summary code block like this (max 3, for space):
````markdown
```tag-summary
tags: #tag1 #tag2 
sections: Section 1, Section 2 //  Header sections in the same note.
```
````

Enable these buttons in plugin settings. Thanks to [QuickAdd Plugin](https://github.com/chhoumann/quickadd) for the logic behind inserting content under headers.

### üìú  Use 8: Bake/create tag summary note
![Copy To Section Demo](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8971804/274069678-4191d61b-109b-4e90-a770-44dedc5edfce.gif)

**Summary buttons**: Using the include, exclude, and max parameters of the tag summary code block you can easily customise and build new notes from tagged content. Copy to clipboard, create new note or bake your summaries into the active note as markdown (replaces the code block). Enable these buttons in plugin settings.

## üßê Why is this useful to me? 
I use tags to connect ideas, but also as a flexible I/O or state/status management system. For example, most of my content comes in through daily notes with tags. Then I have specialized notes that query those tags into an "Inbox" section of the specialized note so I can review and process on-demand.

There‚Äôs lots to do and I‚Äôd like this plugin to grow with Obsidian and the community. Your support will ensure on-going development and maintenance.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Settings
- Override native tag search. Toggle off to use **CMD/CTRL+CLICK** to remove tag, restoring native  tag search on click.
- Convert to tag text with **ALT/OPT+CLICK**. Toggle off to use **ALT/OPT+CLICK** to perform native tag search.
- Remove child tags first. Toggle off to use **SHIFT+CLICK** to remove child tags first. 
- Override native mobile tag search. Toggle on to restore mobile native tag search on tap. Tag removal will then use LONG-PRESS.
- Show mobile notices. Toggle off to hide notices when editing or removing a tag.
- Specify the copy-to-section prefix when using buttons in tag summary.
- Enable tag summary paragraph action buttons. 
- Disable tag summary buttons.
- Edit recently added tags.
- Lock recently added tags

## üóíÔ∏è Notes
- Switch to editing to undo any edits in the active note. 
	- **Edits are permanent in embeds/summaries (unless that note is open in a tab). I'm considering undo functionality with notices.**
- **Known limitations:**    
	 - Editing tags within some other plugins or unknown view types is not supported, for now. Please reach out if you have a use case.
	 - Checkboxes are superficially functional in summaries. But the state change isn't applied to the source file. This functionality might be beyond the scope of this plugin. But I will implement warnings.
	 - Two (or more) tag summaries or embeds in the same note referencing the same tags will lose sync with each other. Warnings have been implemented. WORKAROUND: Use the **Refresh button** below the tag summary to manually update.
