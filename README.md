# Obsidian Tag Buddy 🔖
Add, edit and remove tags in reading mode. Copy, move or edit tagged blocks in reading and edit mode. 

### ✏️  Use 1: Add tags to note in reading mode
![Add Tag Demo](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8971804/273914678-1f574966-a8fe-4fe4-8c91-7c3ef828c8c9.gif)

Add tag to text block/areas with **CTRL/CMD+RIGHT-CLICK**. **TRIPLE-TAP** on mobile. Recently added tags are saved. Lock this list in settings, effectively making a favorites list. 

### 🫥 Use 2: Remove tags in reading mode
![Remove Tag Demo](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8971804/273923015-9eb2de41-3aeb-4243-9655-efdf4fd70ace.gif)

**CLICK** to remove tags in the active note, embedded note/block or generated tag summary blocks. **DOUBLE-TAP** on mobile. Hold **CTRL/CMD+CLICK** to use the native tag search. Customize this in plugin settings. 

### 🪺  Use 3: Edit nested tags in reading mode
![Nested Tag Demo](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8971804/273923013-0b449539-cd7d-4c50-bb30-a2eb7c66dc93.gif)

If there are nested tags, Tag Buddy will progressively remove these first. 

### 🧼  Use 4: Convert tags to text in reading mode
![Convert Tag Demo](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8971804/273923003-d22b0c3e-39dc-4444-8716-fa9bcb327319.gif)

Removes the hash (converts the tag to text) with **OPT/ALT+CLICK** on desktop or **PRESS+HOLD** on mobile.

### 🔎  Use 5: Add/edit tags in tag summaries
![Tag Summary Demo](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8971804/274069683-1e6257a6-f6d6-402a-adae-c534c2f5a507.gif)

Tags are editable in the active note, native embeds and when rendered using a tag summary code block. Use this syntax:
````markdown
```tag-summary
tags: #tag1 #tag2 // Results can have either of these tags 
include: #tag3 #tag4 // Results must have both these tags (optional)
exclude: #tag5 #tag6 // But not have these tags (optional)
max: 3 // Limits the results in the summary (optional)
```
````
Thanks to [Tag Summary Plugin](https://github.com/macrojd/tag-summary) for the original code behind the summaries.
### 🔤  Use 6: Copy/remove tagged blocks
- **Copy button:** copy's paragraph to clipboard.
- **Remove-tag button:** removes the queried tag from the paragraph (which also removes it from the summary).
	- Made a mistake? Use notices to easily jump to the tagged note.
![Notice Demo](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8971804/274208965-fb8423e7-4f64-4bf6-84e8-afe1d44d81b4.gif)

Enable these buttons in plugin settings. 

### 📑   Use 7: Copy/move tagged blocks to section
![Copy To Section Demo](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8971804/274069666-d56b899c-1d74-411b-8b6e-c048bc8df491.gif)

Buttons added to each tagged paragraph in summaries let you copy the paragraph (with a back link) to header sections in the active note. Use **CTRL/CMD** when clicking to also remove the tag, effectively moving the paragraph to the section. These buttons will appear when you add section details to the tag summary code block like this (max 3, for space):
````markdown
```tag-summary
tags: #tag1 #tag2 
sections: Section 1, Section 2 //  Header sections in the same note.
```
````

Enable these buttons in plugin settings. Thanks to [QuickAdd Plugin](https://github.com/chhoumann/quickadd) for the logic behind inserting content under headers.

### 📜  Use 8: Bake/create tag summary note
![Copy To Section Demo](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8971804/274069678-4191d61b-109b-4e90-a770-44dedc5edfce.gif)

**Summary buttons**: Using the include, exclude, and max parameters of the tag summary code block you can easily customise and build new notes from tagged content. Copy to clipboard, create new note or bake your summaries into the active note as markdown (replaces the code block). Enable these buttons in plugin settings.

## 🧐 Why is this useful to me? 
I use tags to connect ideas, but also as a flexible I/O or state/status management system. For example, most of my content comes in through daily notes with tags. Then I have specialized notes that query those tags into an "Inbox" section of the specialized note so I can review and process on-demand.

## 🗒️ Notes
- Switch to editing to undo any edits in the active note. 
	- **Edits are permanent in embeds/summaries (unless that note is open in a tab). I'm considering undo functionality with notices.**
- **Design rationale:** Tag Buddy is about helping you maintain a specific state of mind when reviewing/annotating/processing your notes. For example, I don't want to switch to editing to simply remove “new” from a “book/highlight/new” tag, or if I want to quickly add a “todo” tag somewhere. Also, I think Obsidian already makes it super easy add/edit/remove tags. So there are no plans to bring those Tag Buddy functions to edit mode. That said, please let me know if you have a use case.
- **Known limitations:**    
	 - Editing tags within some other plugins or unknown view types is not supported, for now. Please reach out if you have a use case.
	 - Checkboxes are superficially functional in summaries. But the state change isn't applied to the source file. This functionality might be beyond the scope of this plugin. But I will implement warnings.
	 - Two (or more) tag summaries or embeds in the same note referencing the same tags will lose sync with each other. Warnings have been implemented. WORKAROUND: Use the **Refresh button** below the tag summary to manually update.
