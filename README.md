# Tag Buddy

A collection of tag functionalities for Obsidian. 

**Functionality 1:** Quick delete in-line 

Replicates the quick delete functionality of the #tagName(x) in YAML or properties panel. Why? I use tags to connect ideas, but also as a flexible I/O or state/status management system. For example, most of my content comes in through daily notes with tags. Then I have specialized notes that query those tags into an "Inbox" section of the specialized note so I can review on-demand. This functionality saves a few clicks, and with future updates, a few more. 

**How to use**
- Click/tap a tag in reading mode and it delete from your note.
- Hold ctrl/cmd+click to preserve the native functionality (tag search).
- For now, only use this with tags in the current note. 
- For now, the functionality only works in reading mode. 
- Switch to editing to undo any deletions. 
- Works best with [Tag Summary](https://github.com/macrojd/tag-summary) and [Colored Tags](https://github.com/pfrankov/obsidian-colored-tags) plugins.
